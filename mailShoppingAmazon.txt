Subject : List of things needed for the project

Good morning,

Here is the list of the things I would need from amazon :

- 3 raspberry pi Pico microcontrollers : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0861WJ2DD/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?smid=A26TCVWBQE4D9T&psc=1
- spare motor drivers (I will continue with the same drivers) : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C5JCF5RS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_8?smid=A2RFXKS6GNXFWP&psc=1
- Various supplies and tools : 
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WWWPR2X/ref=ox_sc_act_title_9?smid=A2Z49KHVV4P4WN&th=1
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089CW7YSR/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=AMHYOXF0C8EDF&th=1
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09T6SJBV5/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?smid=A1PKC2PUMNR8VD&th=1
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0812TYT5L/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A1ZRRCZIF57JQ9&th=1
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085VMP7PB/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A2WQHRXT5HY1G4&th=1
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TVMRFV8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3QR7MJ9FCPSP7&th=1

If you don't find the 2D lidar you were mentioning, here is an inexpensive one I have experience with : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B1QCV4XR/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AIJ7WJJN4HG6E&psc=1

As for the 3D printer I was recommending here it is :
- https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?variant=42153262743688
Their website also have PLA, PETG and ABS Filament available for a reasonable price.


As for the lack of encoders on the motors currently present on the platform, after some testing I found that the motors lack torque at low speed, which might make control harder. Having encoders would allow for a more precise control of the motors and would allow for more advanced control algorithms to be implemented. I have not yet found substitute motors with encoders that would fit the platform.
